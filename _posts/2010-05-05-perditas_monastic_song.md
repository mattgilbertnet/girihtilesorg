Matt Gilbert created a never-ending animation that shows the self-similar nature of a particular pattern found in Islamic architecture that uses girih tiles.

It was used to create four mandalas for an animation called "Perdita's Monastic Song", part of a multimedia collaboration called <a href="http://www.unlessanduntil.info/" target="_blank">Unless & Until</a>. Unless & Until is a collaboration between a painter, Julie PÃ¼ttgen, a writer, JS Van Buskirk, and a composer, James Carlson. The project includes 24 songs and animation appearing throughour the story. In the animation, Perdita tells of her monastic past and sings a song that she learned during her time in the hermitage, about the four elements: water, air, earth, fire. A mandala was made for each element by simply replacing the girih tile diamonds, bow ties, etc, with elements taken from Julie's paintings.
